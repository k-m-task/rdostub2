# rdostub2
## About
This is my attempt to create an exact clone of the API built by Random.org. The stack that I have chosen to implement is Linux, Apache, Java and MariaDB.
## Motivation
I love numbers, especially random numbers. But I also love programming. There's a certain indescribable quality to true randomness that I am quite fond of. As a tribute to the great work that the RandomOrg team  have done over in Ireland, I started this project to not only improve my understanding of REST and the tech stack, but also make a great addition to future projects with greater scope.
